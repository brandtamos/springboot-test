**Springboot Test App**

This app is meant to demonstrate calling the Salesforce API from withiin a springboot application. 

In order to authenticate, you will have to add your credentials in the /src/main/hello/SalesforceController.java file 
(I realized this is not ideal, but this is merely for demonstration purposes).

You can access the UI on port 8080. There are a couple different pages to demo CRUD operations in salesforce
using the API.

http://localhost:8080/sfui/create will allow you to create a new account record in salesforce.

http://localhost:8080/sfui/create allows you to look up an existing account by Id and modify a couple fields.
